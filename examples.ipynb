    "The brutal ousting of Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister and the elevation of Scott Morrison dominated the front pages of newspapers.\n",
    "In the Fairfax papers, the Sydney Morning Herald wrote that Morrison’s “new generation” of Liberal party leadership would face its first test early, after Turnbull’s confirmed he would leave the parliament rather than remain on the front bench.\n",
    "In Melbourne, the Age splashed with the new prime minister’s pledge to voters – “we’re on your side”.\n",
    "The Australian splashed with the headline “ScoMo leads new generation”, and wrote that the new prime minister had “vowed to rebuild a ravaged government and set a new course that would focus on the economy, national security, and immediate relief for victims of the drought”.\n",
    "Among the tabloids, the Herald Sun in Melbourne took the prize for best headline with “ScoMo A Go-Go”, a reference to Morrison’s first speech as prime minister on Friday where he pledged “a fair go for having a go” and “a fair go for those who have a go”.\n",
    "Up north, the usually reliably roguish NT News lost its sense of humour after the long week in politics. The headline “who’s next?” accompanied a series of black and white photographs of the long list of victims from Australia’s decade-long leadership turmoil.\n",
    "In trademark all-caps, the paper’s editors addressed the sombre tone:\n",
